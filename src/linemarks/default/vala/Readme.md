# Linemarks
`linemarks.c` and `linemarks.h` are generated from `linemarks.vala` by `valac`, the `vala` compiler. The rule to generate these files is defined in `dune` with a *fallback mode*. This means that `linemarks.c` and `linemarks.h` will only be generated when they are not present in the source tree. This method enables compatibility with older versions of `glib` and allows to track them by `git`.

We need this approach for following reasons:
- `valac` is not shipped in the `vfdeps` package for windows. Hence, it is not possible to generate `linemarks.c` and `linemarks.h` on windows.
- The code generated by `valac` on unix is incompatible with the `glib` version included in the `vfdeps` package for windows, because the version of `glib` shipped in `vfdeps` for windows is lower compared to the version of `glib` used on unix.
